# algorithm-practice
A collection of algorithm implementations in Python, C++, and other languages for practice and learning.

## Structure

The repository is structured by language and algorithm category:

```
algorithm-practice/
├── python/
│   ├── searching/
│   │   ├── binary_search.py
└── ...
```

## Algorithms Implemented

### Python

- **Searching**
  - [Binary Search](python/searching/binary_search.py)

## Future Plans
- Add more algorithms.
- Implement the same algorithms in other languages like C++.
